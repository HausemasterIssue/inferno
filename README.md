A re-done version of my very very very old anarchy Minecraft client using Forge 1.12.2

This isn't fully done, so if you want to use it you can either find a JAR in the releases, but I barely add new things there. So, you should [build](#building) it yourself.

This is also meant for Anarchy Environments, I do not encourage you to use this on non anarchy servers.

## building

You need Java 8 installed to build the client. I personally use Java 8u101, but any version of Java 8 should work just fine with building the client.

Download the code and run these commands in a terminal opened in the directory where you downloaded the code:

```
For Windows:

/gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
/gradlew clean
/gradlew build

For Mac:

./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

Look in the builds/libs folder, and use the one with the -release tag at the end of it before the .jar file extension.
